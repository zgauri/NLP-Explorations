## Introduction

This project aims to create a machine translation model that translates English sentences into French using a dataset of English-French sentence pairs. The notebook walks through the entire process of text preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `eng-fra.txt`, which contains a large number of English sentences paired with their corresponding French translations. The file is crucial for training the translation model and is called directly within the `NLP.ipynb` notebook.

### Dataset Structure

- Each line in the `eng-fra.txt` file consists of an English sentence followed by its French translation, separated by a tab (`\t`).
- Example:
  ```
  Go.    Va !
  Hello!    Bonjour !
  ```

## Installation

To set up the environment for running the notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP-Translation-Project.git
   cd NLP-Translation-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   If you're using Homebrew for package management, install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   brew install <package-name>
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use pip to install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset:**
   Make sure the `eng-fra.txt` file is present in the same directory as the notebook.

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   Start the Jupyter notebook server to explore the `NLP.ipynb` file.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Notebook Overview

The `NLP.ipynb` notebook covers the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Reading the `eng-fra.txt` file.
   - Cleaning and tokenizing the text.
   - Converting text to sequences of integers for model input.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Defining an encoder-decoder architecture for translation.
   - Implementing attention mechanisms to improve translation accuracy.

3. **Training the Model:**
   - Compiling the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
   - Training the model on the dataset.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Testing the model on unseen data.
   - Measuring translation accuracy and other performance metrics.

5. **Prediction:**
   - Translating new English sentences to French using the trained model.

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

1. Open the `NLP.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the cells sequentially to understand each step of the process.
3. Modify or extend the code for experimenting with different models or datasets.

### Translating New Sentences

After training the model, you can use it to translate new English sentences into French. The notebook provides examples of how to input new sentences and get the translated output.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NLTK

These dependencies can be installed using the command mentioned in the Installation section.
