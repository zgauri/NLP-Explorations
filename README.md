## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. This notebook is aimed at providing a detailed walkthrough of various NLP techniques, starting from basic text processing to advanced model training.

## Installation

To get started with the notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with some specific libraries. Below are the steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP-Notebook.git
   cd NLP-Notebook
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   You can install the required Python libraries using Homebrew, as you're using it for package management:

   ```bash
   brew install <package-name>
   ```

   For pip users, you can install the libraries using the requirements file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   Start the Jupyter notebook server to explore the `NLP.ipynb` file.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Notebook Overview

The `NLP.ipynb` notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword Removal
   - Stemming and Lemmatization

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Bag of Words (BoW)
   - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

3. **Model Training:**
   - Classification models
   - Sequence models

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score

5. **Advanced Topics:**
   - Word Embeddings
   - Neural Network-based models
   - Attention Mechanisms
